First -- A Digital Clock is a GUI application that displays the current time in HH:MM:SS format and updates every second. It mimics the look and feel of a physical or digital device clock.

Second -- A Password Generator is a program that creates strong, random passwords using a mix of characters such as:

----- Uppercase letters

----- Lowercase letters

----- Digits

This ensures the password is secure and less prone to brute-force attacks.
